# NEXT MEAL
![Hireable](https://cdn.rawgit.com/hiendv/hireable/master/styles/default/yes.svg)

NextMeal is a static web page based on the PatashuleKE UI design that I got from Behance. I developed the UI considering a web app that connects people with the best restaurant in their cities. NextMeal flourished to accomplish the HTML and CSS capstone project.
